addon for godot engine (current tested on godot version 4.4) 
A plugin that can automatically add collision or RigidBody to any mesh in your level,
with only click of a button! The entire process is automated. 



when you try add collision or rigid body in godot(whitout this addon) it is kind of annoying, you need...
1. create rigid body
2. drag your mesh to this rigid body
3. create collision for the mesh (if the mesh is FBX or GLB or BLEND you need to enable editable children)
4. drag the collision to the rigid body


what if you want to add 100 rigid body for all kinds of meshes? you need to reapeat this 100 times!
it will take a lot of time!


whit this plugin it's only take 1 click!!!
